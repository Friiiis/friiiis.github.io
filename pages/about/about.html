    <p>My name is Gustav Friis-Hansen. I'm 22 and currently studying Software Development at the IT University of Copenhagen.</p>
    <p>I've always had a passion for digital designing. I have spent many hours when I was a teenager designing logos for fictional football clubs, which has given me countless of hours of experience in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Later I got interested in programming and in this field I can combine two of my favorite things: designing and creating.</p>
    <p>I love programming since it lets me create stuff. When I was a child i loved playing with LEGOs for the same reason.</p>
